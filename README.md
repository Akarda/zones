### Zone.js integration for meteor

With Zone.JS integration, we can follow Meteor's async execution path (in client) and identify more information which is not possible before.

We've added **async stack-trace support** for client side errors with this package. See following demo:

### Installation

    mrt add zones

That's all you've to do :)

> There are lot more things we can do with Zone.Js. We'll be releasing more goodies later on.
